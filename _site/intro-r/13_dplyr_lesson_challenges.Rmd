## Challenge 1

Write a single command (which can span multiple lines and includes pipes) that
will produce a dataframe that has the African values for `lifeExp`, `country` and `year`, but not for other Continents.  How many rows does your dataframe have and why?

---

## Challenge 2


Calculate the average life expectancy per country. Which has the longest average life
expectancy and which has the shortest average life expectancy?

---

## Advanced Challenge

Calculate the average life expectancy in 2002 of 2 randomly selected countries
for each continent. Then arrange the continent names in reverse order.
**Hint:** Use the `dplyr` functions `arrange()` and `sample_n()`, they have
similar syntax to other dplyr functions.
