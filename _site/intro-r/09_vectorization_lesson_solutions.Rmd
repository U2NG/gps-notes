## Solution to challenge 1

Let's try this on the `pop` column of the `gapminder` dataset.

Make a new column in the `gapminder` data frame that
contains population in units of millions of people.
Check the head or tail of the data frame to make sure
it worked.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
gapminder$pop_millions <- gapminder$pop / 1e6
head(gapminder)
```

## Solution to challenge 2

Refresh your plotting skills by plotting population in millions against year.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = year, y = pop_millions)) +
 geom_point()
countryset <- c("China","India","Indonesia")
ggplot(gapminder[gapminder$country %in% countryset,],
       aes(x = year, y = pop_millions)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Solution to challenge 3

Given the following matrix:

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3, ncol=4)
m
```

Write down what you think will happen when you run:

1. `m ^ -1`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
m ^ -1
```

2. `m * c(1, 0, -1)`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
m * c(1, 0, -1)
```

3. `m > c(0, 20)`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
m > c(0, 20)
```

##  Solution to Challenge 4

We're interested in looking at the sum of the
following sequence of fractions:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
 x = 1/(1^2) + 1/(2^2) + 1/(3^2) + ... + 1/(n^2)
```

This would be tedious to type out, and impossible for
high values of n.
Can you use vectorisation to compute x, when n=100?
How about when n=10,000?

```{r}
sum(1/(1:100)^2)
sum(1/(1:1e04)^2)
n <- 10000
sum(1/(1:n)^2)
```

We can also obtain the same results using a function:

```{r}
inverse_sum_of_squares <- function(n) {
  sum(1/(1:n)^2)
}
inverse_sum_of_squares(100)
inverse_sum_of_squares(10000)
n <- 10000
inverse_sum_of_squares(n)
```
