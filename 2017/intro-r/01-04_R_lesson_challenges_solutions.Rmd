## Lesson 1: Intro to R Challenges


### Solution to challenge 1

The following can be used as R variables:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
min_height
max.height
MaxLength
celsius2kelvin
```

The following creates a hidden variable:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
.mass
```

The following will not be able to be used to create a variable
```{r, eval=FALSE}
_age
min-length
2widths
```
---


### Solution to challenge 2

```{r ch2pt1-sol}
mass <- 47.5
```
This will give a value of `r mass` for the variable mass

```{r ch2pt2-sol}
age <- 122
```
This will give a value of `r age` for the variable age

```{r ch2pt3-sol}
mass <- mass * 2.3
```
This will multiply the existing value of `r mass/2.3` by 2.3 to give a new value of
`r mass` to the variable mass.

```{r ch2pt4-sol}
age <- age - 20
```
This will subtract 20 from the existing value of `r age + 20 ` to give a new value
of `r age` to the variable age.

---


### Solution to challenge 3

One way of answering this question in R is to use the `>` to set up the following:
```{r, eval=TRUE}
mass > age
```

This should yield a boolean value of TRUE since `r mass` is greater than `r age`.

---


### Solution to challenge 4

We can use the `rm` command to accomplish this task
```{r ch4-sol}
rm(age, mass)
```
---


### Solution to challenge 5

We can use the `install.packages()` command to install the required packages.
```{r ch5-sol, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("plyr")
install.packages("gapminder")
```

## Lesson 2: Project Management with RStudio 

### Challenge 1 - good for class! 

Download the gapminder data from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv).

1. Download the file (CTRL + S, right mouse click -> "Save as", or File -> "Save page as")
2. Make sure it's saved under the name `gapminder-FiveYearData.csv`
3. Save the file in the `data/` folder within your project.

We will load and inspect these data later.

---


### Solution to Challenge 2

By running these commands in the shell:
```{r, engine='bash' }
#ls -lh ~/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv
ls -lh ~/workshops/lecture-notes/gps-skills-2017/r-intro/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv
```


The file size is 80K.
```{r, engine='bash' }
#wc -l ~/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv
wc -l ~/workshops/lecture-notes/gps-skills-2017/r-intro/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv
```


There are 1705 lines and the data looks like:
```{r, engine='bash' }
#head ~/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv
head ~/workshops/lecture-notes/gps-skills-2017/r-intro/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv
```

---



### Solution to Challenge 3-in class

This can be done with the command line:
```
$ mkdir graphs
$ echo "graphs/" >> .gitignore
```

---

## Lesson 3: Seeking Help 


### Solution to Challenge 1

The `c()` function creates a vector, in which all elements are the
same type. In the first case, the elements are numeric, in the
second, they are characters, and in the third they are characters:
the numeric values "coerced" to be characters.

---


### Solution to Challenge 2

Look at the help for the `paste` function. You'll need to use this later.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help("paste")
?paste
```

---

### Challenge 3 - in class

Use help to find a function (and its associated parameters) that you could
use to load data from a csv file in which columns are delimited with "\t"
(tab) and the decimal point is a "." (period). This check for decimal
separator is important, especially if you are working with international
colleagues, because different countries have different conventions for the
decimal point (i.e. comma vs period).
hint: use `??csv` to lookup csv related functions.

## Lesson 4: Data Structures - Part 1 


### Solution to Challenge 1

```{r}
x <- 1:26
x <- x * 2
names(x) <- LETTERS
```

---


### Solution to Challenge 2

One solution is use the argument `stringAsFactors`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cats <- read.csv(file="data/feline-data.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
str(cats$coat)
```

Another solution is use the argument `colClasses`
that allow finer control.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cats <- read.csv(file="data/feline-data.csv", colClasses=c(NA, NA, "character"))
str(cats$coat)
```

---


## Solution to Challenge 3
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
cats[1]
```
We can think of a data frame as a list of vectors. The single brace `[1]`
returns the first slice of the list, as another list. In this case it is the
first column of the data frame.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
cats[[1]]
```
The double brace `[[1]]` returns the contents of the list item. In this case
it is the contents of the first column, a _vector_ of type _factor_.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
cats$coat
```
This example uses the `$` character to address items by name. _coat_ is the
first column of the data frame, again a _vector_ of type _factor_.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
cats["coat"]
```
Here we are using a single brace `["coat"]` replacing the index number with
the column name. Like example 1, the returned object is a _list_.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
cats[1, 1]
```
This example uses a single brace, but this time we provide row and column
coordinates. The returned object is the value in row 1, column 1. The object
is an _integer_ but because it is part of a _vector_ of type _factor_, R
displays the label "calico" associated with the integer value.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
cats[, 1]
```
Like the previous example we use single braces and provide row and column
coordinates. The row coordinate is not specified, R interprets this missing
value as all the elements in this _column_ _vector_.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
cats[1, ]
```
Again we use the single brace with row and column coordinates. The column
coordinate is not specified. The return value is a _list_ containing all the
values in the first row.

---


### Solution to Challenge 4

What do you think will be the result of
`length(matrix_example)`?

```{r}
matrix_example <- matrix(0, ncol=6, nrow=3)
length(matrix_example)
```

Because a matrix is a vector with added dimension attributes, `length`
gives you the total number of elements in the matrix.


---


### Solution to Challenge 5

Make another matrix, this time containing the numbers 1:50,
with 5 columns and 10 rows.
Did the `matrix` function fill your matrix by column, or by
row, as its default behaviour?
See if you can figure out how to change this.
(hint: read the documentation for `matrix`!)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- matrix(1:50, ncol=5, nrow=10)
x <- matrix(1:50, ncol=5, nrow=10, byrow = TRUE) # to fill by row
```

---


### Solution to Challenge 6

```{r}
dataTypes <- c('double', 'complex', 'integer', 'character', 'logical')
dataStructures <- c('data.frame', 'vector', 'factor', 'list', 'matrix')
answer <- list(dataTypes, dataStructures)
```
Note: it's nice to make a list in big writing on the board or taped to the wall
listing all of these types and structures - leave it up for the rest of the workshop
to remind people of the importance of these basics.

---


### Solution to Challenge 7

Consider the R output of the matrix below:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
matrix(c(4, 1, 9, 5, 10, 7), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
```
What was the correct command used to write this matrix? Examine
each command and try to figure out the correct one before typing them.
Think about what matrices the other commands will produce.
```{r, eval=FALSE }
matrix(c(4, 1, 9, 5, 10, 7), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
```

---

## Lesson 5: Exploring Data Frames - Data Structures - Part 2 

---



### Solution to Challenge 1

```{r}
df <- data.frame(first = c('Grace'),
                 last = c('Hopper'),
                 lucky_number = c(0),
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df <- rbind(df, list('Marie', 'Curie', 238) )
df <- cbind(df, coffeetime = c(TRUE,TRUE))
```

---


### Solution to Challenge 2

The contents of `script/load-gapminder.R`:
```{r eval = FALSE}
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv", destfile = "data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
gapminder <- read.csv(file = "data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
```
To run the script and load the data into the `gapminder` variable:
```{r eval = FALSE}
source(file = "scripts/load-gapminder.R")
```


---


### Solution to Challenge 3

The object `gapminder` is a data frame with columns

- `country` and `continent` are factors.

- `year` is an integer vector.

- `pop`, `lifeExp`, and `gdpPercap` are numeric vectors.

## Lesson 6: Data Subsetting 

---


## Solution to challenge 1

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x[2:4]
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
x[-c(1,5)]
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
x[c("b", "c", "d")]
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
x[c(2,3,4)]
```

---


### Solution to challenge 2

A and C are correct.

The `which` command returns the index of every `TRUE` value in its
input. The `names(x) == "g"` command didn't return any `TRUE` values. Because
there were no `TRUE` values passed to the `which` command, it returned an
empty vector. Negating this vector with the minus sign didn't change its
meaning. Because we used this empty vector to retrieve values from `x`, it
produced an empty numeric vector. It was a `named numeric` empty vector
because the vector type of x is "named numeric" since we assigned names to the
values (try `str(x)` ).

---


### Solution to challenge 3

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x_subset <- x[x<7 & x>4]
print(x_subset)
```

---


### Solution to challenge 4

D `m[2,c(4,5)]`

---

### Solution to challenge 5

```{r, eval=FALSE}
xlist$b[2]
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
xlist[[2]][2]
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
xlist[["b"]][2]
```

---


### Solution to challenge 6

```{r, eval=FALSE}
attributes(mod) ## `df.residual` is one of the names of `mod`
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
mod$df.residual
```

---


### Solution to challenge 7

Fix each of the following common data frame subsetting errors:

1. Extract observations collected for the year 1957

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# gapminder[gapminder$year = 1957,]
gapminder[gapminder$year == 1957,]
```

2. Extract all columns except 1 through to 4

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# gapminder[,-1:4]
gapminder[,-c(1:4)]
```

3. Extract the rows where the life expectancy is longer the 80 years

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# gapminder[gapminder$lifeExp > 80]
gapminder[gapminder$lifeExp > 80,]
```

4. Extract the first row, and the fourth and fifth columns (`lifeExp` and `gdpPercap`).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# gapminder[1, 4, 5]
gapminder[1, c(4, 5)]
```

5. Advanced: extract rows that contain information for the years 2002 and 2007

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# gapminder[gapminder$year == 2002 | 2007,]
gapminder[gapminder$year == 2002 | gapminder$year == 2007,]
gapminder[gapminder$year %in% c(2002, 2007),]
```

---


### Solution to challenge 8

1.  `gapminder` is a data.frame so needs to be subsetted on two dimensions. `gapminder[1:20, ]` subsets the data to give the first 20 rows and all columns.

2. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder_small <- gapminder[c(1:9, 19:23),]
```
