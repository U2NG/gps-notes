## Challenge 1

Is gapminder a purely long, purely wide, or some intermediate format?

---

## Challenge 2

Using `gap_long`, calculate the mean life expectancy, population, and gdpPercap for each continent.
**Hint:** use the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions we learned in the `dplyr` lesson

---

## Challenge 3

Take this 1 step further and create a `gap_ludicrously_wide` format data by spreading over countries, year and the 3 metrics?
**Hint** this new dataframe should only have 5 rows.
