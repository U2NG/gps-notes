## Challenge 1

Write a function called `kelvin_to_celsius` that takes a temperature in Kelvin
and returns that temperature in Celsius

Hint: To convert from Kelvin to Celsius you minus 273.15


---

## Challenge 2

Define the function to convert directly from Fahrenheit to Celsius,
by reusing the two functions above (or using your own functions if you prefer).


---


## Challenge 3

Test out your GDP function by calculating the GDP for New Zealand in 1987. How
does this differ from New Zealand's GDP in 1952?

---

## Challenge 4

The `paste` function can be used to combine text together, e.g:

```{r}
best_practice <- c("Write", "programs", "for", "people", "not", "computers")
paste(best_practice, collapse=" ")
```

Write a function called `fence` that takes two vectors as arguments, called
`text` and `wrapper`, and prints out the text wrapped with the `wrapper`:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
fence(text=best_practice, wrapper="***")
```

*Note:* the `paste` function has an argument called `sep`, which specifies the
separator between text. The default is a space: " ". The default for `paste0`
is no space "".
