## Challenge 1

Let's try this on the `pop` column of the `gapminder` dataset.

Make a new column in the `gapminder` data frame that
contains population in units of millions of people.
Check the head or tail of the data frame to make sure
it worked.

## Challenge 2

On a single graph, plot population, in
millions, against year, for all countries. Don't worry about
identifying which country is which.

Repeat the exercise, graphing only for China, India, and
Indonesia. Again, don't worry about which is which.

## Challenge 3

Given the following matrix:

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3, ncol=4)
m
```

Write down what you think will happen when you run:
>
1. `m ^ -1`
2. `m * c(1, 0, -1)`
3. `m > c(0, 20)`
4. `m * c(1, 0, -1, 2)`

Did you get the output you expected? If not, ask a helper!



## Challenge 4

We're interested in looking at the sum of the
following sequence of fractions:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
  x = 1/(1^2) + 1/(2^2) + 1/(3^2) + ... + 1/(n^2)
```

This would be tedious to type out, and impossible for high values of
n.  Use vectorisation to compute x when n=100. What is the sum when
n=10,000?
