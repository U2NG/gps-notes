# OSF Demo for GPS 2017

##### Lesson adapted from Jolene Esposito OSF-Curriculum

## Introduction

Learning objectives:

* Understand the current issues and barrier to reproducibility
* Understand why the whole workflow is important
* Understand documentation/organizational issues underpinning this

### What is the problem?

Researchers often have three broad goals for their work:
* they are interested in studying innovative ideas; they want to discover new things about how the world works

* they are interested in producing reproducible results; they want to be able to find there results again, and they want others to be able to find them as well

* they want to build off their own and others work and in order to accumulate knowledge over time; they want research to move our understanding of the work forward
