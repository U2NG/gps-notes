# OSF Demo for GPS 2017

##### Lesson adapted from Jolene Esposito OSF-Curriculum

# Lesson 3: Documenting as you go

Learning objectives:

* Understand how to effectively document **during the process**
 * Uploading files
 * Version control on the OSF


* Understanding the importance of certain lifecycle points
 * Creating Registrations
 * GUIDs/DOIs

## Registrations (Overview)
There are also specific points in a projects life that may be particularly important and that we may want to freeze and always be able to go back to. For example, what the project looked like just before we started data collection (often called a pre-registration), or what the project looked like when it was accepted for publication are two points that we may want to easily be able to get back to, or easily share with others.

One way to keep track of these important points is to **create registrations**.

A **registration** creates a frozen snapshot of a project, or section of a project, that can never be deleted or changed.

 Basically, it’s a **permanent, read-only copy of that part of the project.**

### ***Lecture Note:***
 **Only show how you go about registering a project.**

 **Do not follow along** with this section, as registrations are **not reversible.**

### Demo Registrations
* First thing is to click on the **registration** tab on the top of the project.

* **Note that this will register the part of the project you’re currently in, and all components and folders nested within this part of the project.**

* There are a few different **registration templates** that you can choose from that will allow you to fill in some information about the registration you are making.

* If you are unsure, choose the **Open-ended Registration** and this will give you the ability to provide some information about why you are registering the project. This is important, as you can have multiple registrations of a project and this section will allow you to tell them apart.

* There are **two options** for how you want to release your registrations.
 * make them **public immediately**, which means anyone will be able to see them

 * you can **place an embargo** on the registration.  
   * If you choose to embargo, the project will be immediately registered, but the registration will not be made public until after the embargo date that you specify. You can embargo registrations for up to four years, but after that they must become public.

#### ***Note about Embargoes***

Why might you want to set an embargo date? If you are doing a preregistration, and your study hasn’t happened yet, you may want to embargo the registration so that participants and/or RAs cannot discover what you’re hypotheses are in order to preserve blinding in your study. Some researchers are also afraid of being ‘scooped’ and so they may not want to release their study protocol before the study is completed. If you are doing a a registration after a study has finished, you may also need the embargo feature because the journal you submitted to may have an embargo period. All these are valid reasons, which is why we give the option of either embargoes or immediate public release for registrations.

If you choose the embargo feature, an email will be sent to all the administrators on the project, asking if they want to cancel the registration, since you can’t undo registrations or change embargo dates after the fact. **If any of the admins cancels the registration within 48 hours, the registration does not occur.** If they all either approve it, or ignore the email, the registration goes through and the embargo period is set.


### After registration is completed

A few things to notice about the registration.

* Firstly, the registration GUID is different from the projects, so you can easily use the links to send people to either the project, or the registration, whichever is more appropriate. For this registration, I chose to make it public immediately. Just like the actual project and registration have different GUIDs, they also have different privacy settings. So, even though the registration is public, the actual project is still private, and I can make changes to that project which non-contributors will not be able to see. Since this is a public registration, you’ll notice that you can request a DOI/ARK ID for the registration. Especially if you are registering at the end of a project, the journal you a submitting to may require a DOI, and so registering the project is the way to get a DOI for the contents.

* For embargoed registrations, once the embargo ends and they become public, you can obtain a DOI for them.

# Files and Version Control
Now we want to start actually working on our project.

We had previously uploaded our materials when we set up the storage, but now we need to make sure we upload our data.

You always want to **keep a copy of our complete, raw data file.** Even if we end up doing a lot of data cleaning, or only using a subset of the datafile for our analyses, we want to keep a raw, untouched version of the data file to make sure we can always create our analyses from start to finish.

## ***Activity***
**Upload raw data file and data dictionary.**

* Name the data file accordingly and upload it to the appropriate section of you project.

* We also want to upload the data dictionary so we’ll always know what our variable names actually mean.





so now we have the static version of all these different files, but in real research, things often change over time. We need a way to easily track those changes. This tracking of different versions of a file is usually called ‘version control’. Often times people have their own ad-hoc version control procedures,


## ***Activity***
**update wiki to reflect analyses done & clearly comment analysis scripts**




## ***Activity***
**update wiki to include navigational README for the project**
