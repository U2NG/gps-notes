# OSF Demo for GPS 2017

##### Lesson adapted from Jolene Esposito OSF-Curriculum

## Setting up a collaborative space

Learning objectives:

* Understand how to set up a centralized location for project storage/management.

* Understand the purpose and use of the wiki.

* Understand how the different ways folders and components can be used to organize a project.


## Materials Overview

## ***Activity***
download materials from [OSF Github repo]

## Creating a project
* We talked before about the problems that can arise when we either don’t document work, or we try and go and back document work once a study is accepted for publication. This becomes even more challenging when you have multiple collaborators, especially if they are at different institutions, and you have been sending materials back and forth by email.

* What you’ll often end up with is a very distribute network of materials, so you’ll have some things on your computer, some things in dropbox, a bunch of different version of some things going back and forth in various email threads.

* Collaborators perhaps getting out of version sync with each other…this makes it very difficult to try and go back and recreate the workflow or find particular files.

* to solve some of these problems, we’re going to set up a collaborate space for our research study using the OSF to help document and organize our research all in one place for everyone involved in the project.

* Now that you’re all signed in, you should be all be seeing the **project dashboard**.

* A **project** on the site can be anything: a lab group, an organization, a grant, a line of research, an individual experiment, etc.

## ***Activity***
Since we don’t have any projects yet, and we’re only going to be working on one research project, lets just create a project for that one study.

* Select a person in your group to create a project.

* click on the **create project** button, and give the project whatever name you like.

You can also give it a short description if you want, but you don’t have to.

* create the project

As the project creator, you should now be seeing something that looks similar to my screen.

* This is the **project overview** page.

Any project you create on the site will start out basically looking like this, and then you can customize it to fit the needs of that particular project or workflow.

The **project overview** page has a few different sections.

* **wiki** is a collaborative editing space that you can use to include important overview information about the project, things like READMEs, abstracts, research questions, outlines, etc.

* **file tree** is how you upload and navigate to files to the system; you can upload basically any type of file that you want, everything from CSVs to word documents, to power points, to image and video files.

* **Component** section is how you add additional structure and nesting to your project

* **citation widget**, which shows you the automatically generated citation for the project
